# About:
Bonzai is a tool made for the VR game Echo VR that reads the the games local API and provides QOL features to the user.<br>

Bonzai was created due to [Spark](https://github.com/NtsFranz/Spark) losing some functionality after the games public shutdown on August 1st, 2023. The goal of this project is to serve as an alternative to people who want some of the features that were removed while also providing some new ones that [Spark](https://github.com/NtsFranz/Spark) didn't offer.

Development is still currently in progression, so if you have any issues, bugs, or crashes, please feel free to make an issue.
